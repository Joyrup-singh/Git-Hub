Explain the Git Workflow, including the staging area, working directory, and repository


The Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. 

1.Staging Area:

In technical terms, the staging area is the middle ground between what you have done to your files (also known as the working directory) and what you had last committed (the HEAD commit). As the name implies, the staging area gives you space to prepare (stage) the changes that will be reflected on the next commit.

2.Working Directory:

Working Directoryâ€‹ Git directory serves to record the file versions you authorized Git to track. However, you create a working repository to store any file. In other words, you can use a working directory to store files (or folders) that are under version control and those that are not.

3.Repository:

A Git repository is a central storage location for managing and tracking changes in files and directories. It is a crucial component of the Git version control system, which enables collaborative development and allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously.
