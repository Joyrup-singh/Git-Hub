GitHub is an increasingly popular programming resource used for code sharing. It's a social networking site for programmers that many companies and organizations use to facilitate project management and collaboration.

1. Easy Project Management

GitHub is a place where project managers and developers come together to coordinate, track, and update their work so that projects are transparent and stay on schedule.

2. Increased Safety With Packages

Packages can be published privately, within the team, or publicly to the open-source community. The packages can be used or reused by downloading them from GitHub.

3. Effective Team Management

GitHub helps all the team members stay on the same page and organized. Moderation tools like Issue and Pull Request Locking help the team to focus on the code.

4. Improved Code Writing

Pull requests help the organizations to review, develop, and propose new code. Team members can discuss any implementations and proposals through these before changing the source code.

5. Increased Code Safety

GitHub uses dedicated tools to identify and analyze vulnerabilities to the code that other tools tend to miss. Development teams everywhere work together to secure the software supply chain, from start to finish.

6. Easy Code Hosting

All the code and documentation are in one place. There are millions of repositories on GitHub, and each repository has its own tools to help you host and release code.
